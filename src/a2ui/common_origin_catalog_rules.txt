**CHILDREN:** Children are always referenced by ID, never defined inline. Use a 'Stack' component to group multiple children when a component expects a single child.

**DATA BINDING:** Use plain strings/numbers for static values. Use { "path": "/some/key" } to bind to the data model. Paths follow JSON Pointer (RFC 6901) syntax.

**CURRENCY:** All monetary amounts default to AUD. Always use negative numbers for debits/expenses and positive for credits/income.

**ACTIONS:** Action objects have { "name": "actionName", "context": { ... } }. Use 'dataPath' to specify which data model key to update with the new value.
